==Before you Begin Recording Prompts==

Position your microphone so it does not pick up your breathing.  While recording, try to minimize any non-speech noises (i.e. lip smacking, taking a breath, ...) or background noise.  Don't exhale until after you have clicked the Stop button. 

The black box near the bottom of your screen will display the audio waveform of your recording. Please [http://code.google.com/p/voxforge/wiki/RecordingHowto record a test recording] to ensure your microphone volume is not too high or too low.

==Recording Prompts ==

For each prompt line, please record your speech as follows:

   # click the Record button,
   # pause for half a second,
   # read the corresponding prompt sentence,
   # pause for half a second, and then
   # click the the Stop button.

If you make a mistake, click Record again to re-record your prompt.

Once you have completed recording all ten prompts the Upload button will activate. Click the Upload button to upload your entire submission to the !VoxForge repository as a single zip file.

Repeat the process (multiple are submissions encouraged!)
